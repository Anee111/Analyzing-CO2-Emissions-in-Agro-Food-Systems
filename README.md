# Analyzing CO2 Emissions in Agro-Food Systems

The Dataset includes information about Temperature increase and an extensive list of features that represent the emissions coming from different activities of the agri-food sector. The aim of this project is to investigate the relationship between those features and temperature increase.

In doing so, an extensive exploratory data analysis will take place, as well as a correlation analysis and null values handling.

Bellow are all the variables included in the dataset:

The values of features represent in Gg Gigagrams ( 1Gg = 1000 metric tonnes)

Savanna fires: Emissions from fires in savanna ecosystems.

Forest fires: Emissions from fires in forested areas.

Crop Residues: Emissions from burning or decomposing leftover plant material after crop harvesting.

Rice Cultivation: Emissions from methane released during rice cultivation.

Drained organic soils (CO2): Emissions from carbon dioxide released when draining organic soils.

Pesticides Manufacturing: Emissions from the production of pesticides.

Food Transport: Emissions from transporting food products.

Forestland: change in forst land( In hectares)

Net Forest conversion: Change in forest area due to deforestation and afforestation ( In hectares).

Food Household Consumption: Emissions from food consumption at the household level.

Food Retail: Emissions from the operation of retail establishments selling food.

On-farm Electricity Use: Electricity consumption on farms.

Food Packaging: Emissions from the production and disposal of food packaging materials.

Agrifood Systems Waste Disposal: Emissions from waste disposal in the agrifood system.

Food Processing: Emissions from processing food products.

Fertilizers Manufacturing: Emissions from the production of fertilizers.

IPPU: Emissions from industrial processes and product use.

Manure applied to Soils: Emissions from applying animal manure to agricultural soils.

Manure left on Pasture: Emissions from animal manure on pasture or grazing land.

Manure Management: Emissions from managing and treating animal manure.

Fires in organic soils: Emissions from fires in organic soils.

Fires in humid tropical forests: Emissions from fires in humid tropical forests.

On-farm energy use: Energy consumption on farms.

Rural population: Number of people living in rural areas.

Urban population: Number of people living in urban areas.

Total Population - Male: Total number of male individuals in the population.

Total Population - Female: Total number of female individuals in the population.

total_emission: Total greenhouse gas emissions from various sources.

Average Temperature Â°C (target) : The average increase of temperature (by year) in degrees CelsiuS.

In the notebook performed:

A) understood the data, data types, missing value count and unique records.
B) identified and removed missing values if required and imputed missing values as required.
C) Created new features based on exisitng features.
D) Performed Univariate and multivariate analysis.
